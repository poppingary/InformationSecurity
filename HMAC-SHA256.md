## Message Authentication Code (MAC)

  - Authenticate a message, in other words, to confirm that the message came from the stated sender and has not been changed.
  - It is similar to a message digest to calculate a hash, but uses a secret key so that only a person with the secret key can verify the authenticity of the message.
